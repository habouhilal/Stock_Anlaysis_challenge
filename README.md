# Stock_Anlaysis_challenge

## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this project is to analyze Greene energy stocks data to help Steve's parent decide on their investment. The project started with the DQ yearly volume to have an idea of how often it gets traded. Then the research was expanded to process the entire dataset, other companies. This analysis helped Steve and his parents have an overview of the entire stocks tickers and make the best investment.

## Results 
  After running a first analysis just for Daqo, we can say it is not the best option to invest on. Adapting the code to run multiple stocks gave us an overview for a larger dataset. Overall, return of investment for ENPH stayed positive for both 2017 and 2018.

  After refactoring the code to run in faster time, Steve is able to run this analysis for a larger dataset faster.

## Summary:

Refactoring code in general have great advantage of saving time to rewrite lines of code. But this may not be positive all the time, because in a lot of cases we are using a code written to sole one problem and applying it to solve another problem. 
The code can limit the results to the data or the outputs we decided on the first problem. 

In this case, the refactored VBA script had the advantage of saving time. This code now can be used on larger dataset and compile in minimum amount of time. 
A disadvantage that we may encounter on this VBA refactored code is to understand the logic of the new code. Using lists and a tickerIndex was confusing and not clear.
